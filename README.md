# Memes
So I got this idea of making the list of memes that I keep for interaction on Discord, and making it a public git repository. This way, if you want, you can put in a pull request, and maybe you can help me and everyone who uses it by adding more to the repository.

Most of these memes are just for simple interaction, like laughing at whoever spoke directly before (or after) you, and others may be useful in normal discussion.

## Matrix Server
The memes channel in my Matrix server, info toast: <https://matrix.to/#/#info-toast:infotoast.ems.host> shows updates made to this repository.

## Copyright stuff
I don't own any of the memes here. We will omit any memes that have watermarks that are made by the creators of the memes (And not meme generator sites). If you made one of those memes originally or own the source material of any meme, and don't want to see the meme here, please notify me. I will have it removed. But given the very definition of memes as something that spreads, I believe that many meme creators are perfectly happy with their memes being used here. I don't make any money off of this. Just bring up an issue if you'd rather your meme not be in this repository. I'll be glad to take it out.
